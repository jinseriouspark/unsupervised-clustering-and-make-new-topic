For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit.""

Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit.""

Renowned New York fitness trainer Pete Cerqua's answer is startling: 15 minutes of exercise a week. Pete's revolutionary strength-training plan includes only the most efficient exercises, which each last 90 seconds but powerfully accelerate your metabolism. By doing these exercises while following his sensible yet simple eating approach and lifestyle advice, you will become stronger and leaner. And this will happen quickly -- so fast that you will shrink your body by a full dress size in just eight weeks. The power of this remarkable program is its simplicity. You can exercise at home without changing into workout clothes. You eat well without counting calories or carbs, and don't even need a complicated grocery list. You don't have to spend a fortune on equipment, gym memberships, supplements, and meal replacement products. Pete has created a truly manageable program for the busiest of women. Complete with more than thirty delicious yet quick-and-easy recipes and backed by dozens of testimonials and hundreds of medical studies, Pete's program is proven to work. The results are dramatic and all the more satisfying because they last. Skeptical? Many of Pete's clients were, too. Then they tried it, and their bodies got tighter and smaller. Their bones got stronger. They slept more deeply, handled stress better, and felt the best they had in years. Then they told fifty friends about Pete. He made believers out of them, and he'll make one out of you, too.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

Pitts,iUniverse,2014,"PERSONAL TRAINERS are not just fitness professionals; they could be the saviours of the global health-care system-life changers. As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry. If you're serious about your personal training career, explores these important issues and start building your protective legal strategies now.",BOOK,Law

As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit.""

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit.""

Complete with more than thirty delicious yet quick-and-easy recipes and backed by dozens of testimonials and hundreds of medical studies, Pete's program is proven to work.

Pitts,iUniverse,2014,"PERSONAL TRAINERS are not just fitness professionals; they could be the saviours of the global health-care system-life changers. As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry. If you're serious about your personal training career, explores these important issues and start building your protective legal strategies now.",BOOK,Law

For readers of Belly of the Beast, Care Work, and The Body is Not an Apology Fit is subjective. Who our society designates as fit--and who gets to be fit in our society--is predefined by the coaches, gyms, and systems at large that uphold and reproduce the Fitness Industrial Complex for their own structural and material gain. The Fitness Industrial Complex uplifts some bodies while denigrating others. Bodies that are Black, Brown, queer, trans, poor, fat, and disabled--bodies that don't conform, that resist and disrupt--are excluded from being ""fit."" Through the stories and experiences of activist trainers, coaches, and bodyworkers of diverse identities and experiences, this anthology interrogates: The ideas and beliefs we’ve internalized about health, fitness, and our own and others’ bodies How to deconstruct and re-envision fitness as a practice for all bodies The fitness industry’s role in upholding and reinforcing oppression Exclusivity, unsafety, and harm in mainstream fitness spaces How to empower ourselves and our communities to push back against the FIC Speaking directly to sick, queer, trans, disabled, and BIPOC readers, Deconstructing the Fitness Industrial Complex is part urgent inquiry, part radical deconstruction, and part call to action: to build spaces that welcome and work for all; to reclaim movement as a vital and liberatory practice; and to embody a model of joy and community care outside the mainstream fitness culture.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

Renowned New York fitness trainer Pete Cerqua's answer is startling: 15 minutes of exercise a week. Pete's revolutionary strength-training plan includes only the most efficient exercises, which each last 90 seconds but powerfully accelerate your metabolism. By doing these exercises while following his sensible yet simple eating approach and lifestyle advice, you will become stronger and leaner. And this will happen quickly -- so fast that you will shrink your body by a full dress size in just eight weeks. The power of this remarkable program is its simplicity. You can exercise at home without changing into workout clothes. You eat well without counting calories or carbs, and don't even need a complicated grocery list. You don't have to spend a fortune on equipment, gym memberships, supplements, and meal replacement products. Pete has created a truly manageable program for the busiest of women. Complete with more than thirty delicious yet quick-and-easy recipes and backed by dozens of testimonials and hundreds of medical studies, Pete's program is proven to work. The results are dramatic and all the more satisfying because they last. Skeptical? Many of Pete's clients were, too. Then they tried it, and their bodies got tighter and smaller. Their bones got stronger. They slept more deeply, handled stress better, and felt the best they had in years. Then they told fifty friends about Pete.

This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice.

As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar.

As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent.

But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent.

Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry.

All in all, there are 120 workout choices, each specifically created to match the exerciser's current goals! Murphy shows how to complete any workout in a time-efficient way and how to compensate for limited time with different exercises that will keep muscles challenged. More than 250 photographs illustrate the exercises, and sound nutritional tips round out this all-new approach to fitness—destined to be the workout bible for countless busy people.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

Renowned New York fitness trainer Pete Cerqua's answer is startling: 15 minutes of exercise a week. Pete's revolutionary strength-training plan includes only the most efficient exercises, which each last 90 seconds but powerfully accelerate your metabolism. By doing these exercises while following his sensible yet simple eating approach and lifestyle advice, you will become stronger and leaner. And this will happen quickly -- so fast that you will shrink your body by a full dress size in just eight weeks. The power of this remarkable program is its simplicity. You can exercise at home without changing into workout clothes. You eat well without counting calories or carbs, and don't even need a complicated grocery list. You don't have to spend a fortune on equipment, gym memberships, supplements, and meal replacement products. Pete has created a truly manageable program for the busiest of women. Complete with more than thirty delicious yet quick-and-easy recipes and backed by dozens of testimonials and hundreds of medical studies, Pete's program is proven to work. The results are dramatic and all the more satisfying because they last. Skeptical? Many of Pete's clients were, too. Then they tried it, and their bodies got tighter and smaller. Their bones got stronger. They slept more deeply, handled stress better, and felt the best they had in years. Then they told fifty friends about Pete. He made believers out of them, and he'll make one out of you, too.",BOOK,Health & Fitness

What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice.

Pitts,iUniverse,2014,"PERSONAL TRAINERS are not just fitness professionals; they could be the saviours of the global health-care system-life changers. As pioneers in this budding field in the health and wellness industry, trainers face misinformation and myths about the fitness industry. What's more, due to negative portrayal in the media, the common perception of personal trainers is less than stellar. This situation, coupled with the relative lack of regulation, means that there are many legal issues that you must be aware of in order to stay safe in your day-today practice. As is the case for any practitioner of a health-related profession, you must be aware of the legal ramifications of your decisions and advice. But the legal education provided to personal trainers is virtually nonexistent. In this guidebook, author Gary Pitts, a master strength coach and Canada's premier fitness lawyer, provides the knowledge you need for your practice. Following the principles of MISS (make it simple, stupid), Gary has compiled information on the entire spectrum of fitness-specific legal issues, most of which are largely unknown or misunderstood by even the most seasoned veterans in the personal training industry. If you're serious about your personal training career, explores these important issues and start building your protective legal strategies now.",BOOK,Law
